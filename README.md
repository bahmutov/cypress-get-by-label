> Example custom Cypress command finding form element by its label

Read [How to Publish Custom Cypress Command on NPM](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/publishing-cypress-command/)

## install

```
npm i -D cypress-get-by-label
# or
yarn add -D cypress-get-by-label
```

## use

### Simple

Include from your Cypress support file or individual spec

```js
import 'cypress-get-by-label/commands'
```

Then use the custom command `cy.getByLabel`

```js
cy.getByLabel('First name:')
```

### Dual command

The `cy.getByLabel` command is dual: you can use it as a parent to start new command chain or as a child command from an existing subject element.

```js
// find the label starting
// from the beginning of the page
cy.getByLabel('First name:').should('have.value', 'Joe')
// limited to the fields inside the form with id "person"
cy.get('form#person')
  .getByLabel('First name:')
  .should('have.value', 'Ann')
```

### Advanced

Include from your Cypress support file or individual spec

```js
const { registerCommand } = require('cypress-get-by-label')
registerCommand()
// or we could register under a different name
registerCommand('getFormField')
```

Then use the command `cy.getByLabel` (default) or the custom name

```js
// if used registerCommand()
cy.getByLabel('First name:')
// if used registerCommand('getFormField')
cy.getFormField('First name:')
```

## types

To get IntelliSense working with the default custom command `cy.getByLabel` include in your specs

```js
/// <reference types="cypress-get-by-label" />
```

For example in VSCode you will see
